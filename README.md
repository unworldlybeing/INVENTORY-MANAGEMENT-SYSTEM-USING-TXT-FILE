# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-TXT-FILE
Making a Inventory management system using Python and File reading (TXT files)
🧾 Inventory Management System
This is a simple Inventory Management System developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to manage inventory by:

Adding new products

Updating existing stock

Selling products

Viewing inventory status

The current version uses a dictionary-based approach with in-notebook state management, suitable for learning and small-scale inventory simulation.

🛠 Features
Add new products with quantity and price

Update existing inventory

Sell products and reduce quantity

View inventory details in real time

📌 Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE

No external libraries required

🚀 How to Run
Download or clone the repository.

Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "Inventory managment system.ipynb"
Run the cells sequentially and interact with the functions as prompted.

📁 Upcoming Enhancements
I will be recreating this project using JSON files to store the inventory data persistently. This version will:

Allow inventory to persist across sessions

Be better suited for more realistic and scalable scenarios

Stay tuned! 😊
